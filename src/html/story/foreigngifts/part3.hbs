  <p>The top 10 countries give anywhere from around $420 million to $1.4 billion dollars to U.S. colleges, and some spread the money out amongs many colleges while others give to only a few institutions. Bermuda, in particular, has given to only 17 universities or colleges. It seemed strange that a relatively small, developing country without much global influence would give so much money to universities abroad. However, in 2016 Carnegie Mellon sucessfully sued Marvell Technology- a company headquartered in Bermuda-- for $750 million over patents. This one payment is responsible for most of the money given from Bermuda on higher education in the U.S. The money coming from other countries came from a variety of entities. When looking at the the top three countries: most of the money from Qatar comes from the Qatari government or organizations funded by the government, most of the money from China comes from companies, and most of the money from England comes from individual, private citizens.</p>
  <p>The data indicating which countries give the most money to U.S. colleges and universities does not match the countries being investigated by the Education Department. Russia is not one of the countries giving the most money, yet is being investigated. Meanwhile, England gives the second most money of any country and is not being investigated. Only a handful of the top 10 countries-- Qatar, Saudi Arabia, China-- are being looked into. Qatar, in particular, is the country that gives most money and whose donations are being investigated.   </p>
